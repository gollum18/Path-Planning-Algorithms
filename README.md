# Path-Planning-Replication

This is a replication I performed of the article "A Statiscally Rigorous Comparison of 2D Path Planning Algoritms".

##DOI for above article
DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxu137

##NOTES ON RUNNING
This implementation makes use of features found in C# 6.0, unless you want to rewrite this code to be backwards compatible
I would suggest only runnning this on a machine that is contains C# 6.0 or above.
